# QuantumCodeChallengeHackathon
Quantum Code Challenge Hackathon for Smart Cities at CTE - Cagliari Digital Lab

[Quantum Code Challenge](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/en/event.page?contentId=EVT881) is a entirely online hackathon on quantum computing applied to smart cities in the [CTE Cagliari DLAB](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/) project framework, organised by [CRS4](https://www.crs4.it/) in collaboration with [Open Campus](https://www.opencampus.it/) and with the endorsement of [Qitaly](https://qworld.net/qitaly/), the italian representative among the national active groups of the QWorld organization.
The event takes place entirely online from 22 to 25 October 2024! 

The hackathon is bilingual, english and italian and participants from all communities are welcome. 

 Objectives of the hackathon are to:
 - spread knowledge about quantum computing techniques and the type of problems it can solve, for students but also for researchers and professionals that work on other fields and maybe they can play with toy problems that are related somehow to their professional focus.
- foster the formation of a network of people who work in or are  passionate about Quantum Computing
- work on model problems and test quantum algorithms on real smart  city datasets provided by CTE-Cagliari Digital Lab, in support of the work carried out in the Quantum Technologies Lab.

Two challenges are available: Smart City QC Apprentice & Smart City QC Wizard.
- The Smart City QC Apprentice challenge involves some coding for smart city-themed toy problems, exploring universal, adiabatic and analog quantum computer paradigms, on the hashtag#Qbraid portal.
- The Smart City QC Wizard challenge is based on QML on a real dataset extracted from the sensors of the city of Cagliari. Partecipants will use the [Qbraid](https:\\www.qbraid.com) Portal and for this challenge you can cast a QML solution based on either the digital or the adiabatic paradigm.
